# 1541-ieee488-interface
Commodore 1541 floppydrive ieee488-interface

The ieee488 interface is compatible with the Commodore floppy drive 1541 (version with built-in power supply).

The interface changes the serial bus into a parallel ieee488 bus. The Commodore floppy drive 1541 becomes comparable to the Commodore floppy drive 2031. The serial bus no longer works after the conversion. Reading and writing on diskettes is up to 6 times faster.

In addition, an ieee488 ROM is required for the floppy drive 1541 as a replacement for the original ROM 901229-03 on UB4.
